# Reddit-app-project

The brief for this Codecademy project was to create an app using React and Redux which will allow users to search for and view Reddit posts from the RedditJSON API. The aesthetics and implementation of the app are entirely to the preference of the developer and the end project is intended to be different for each person on the course.

Tech used:
- React
- React Testing Library
- HTML5
- CSS
- Redux
- Reddit API JSON

I decided to make the site look very similar to the main Reddit site and gave it the name 'RedditLite' so that I had a clear design direction and could practice making a site to a 'wireframe' which was actually just an adaption of the original site with fewer features.

The app will be created locally first, using hard coded data and once I have ensured that everything is functioning, I will start to introduce the RedditJSON API so that the content will meet the specifications of the project.

My aim is to use best practice and TDD to complete this project so that it is a clear demonstration of my knowledge and abilities for any potential employers who may see it.
